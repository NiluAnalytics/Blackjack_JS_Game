# üÉè Blackjack Game

This is a simple, interactive Blackjack (21) game built entirely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Test your luck against the dealer!

## ‚ú® Features

* **Interactive Gameplay:** Start a new game, draw new cards, and see your sum update in real-time.
* **Basic Game Logic:** Implements core Blackjack rules for hitting and standing (though 'standing' is implied by not drawing new cards).
* **Clear UI:** Simple and intuitive interface to play the game.

## üöÄ Live Demo
