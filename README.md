# 🃏 Blackjack Game

This is a simple, interactive Blackjack (21) game built entirely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Test your luck against the dealer!

## ✨ Features

* **Interactive Gameplay:** Start a new game, draw new cards, and see your sum update in real-time.
* **Basic Game Logic:** Implements core Blackjack rules for hitting and standing (though 'standing' is implied by not drawing new cards).
* **Clear UI:** Simple and intuitive interface to play the game.

## 🚀 Live Demo

You can play the game live here:
**[Play Blackjack!](https://niluanalytics.github.io/Blackjack_JS_Game/)**

*(Note: Replace `Blackjack_JS_Game` with the actual name of your repository if it's different. This link will work once you set up GitHub Pages.)*

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the game.
* **CSS3:** For styling and layout.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** For all game logic and DOM manipulation.

2.  Your current cards and their sum will be displayed.
3.  Click the "NEW CARD" button to draw another card.
